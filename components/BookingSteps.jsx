/**
 * The eight client screens a booking walks through, in order: search, profile,
 * purpose, request, the two disclaimer gates, confirmation, payment.
 *
 * Source: mobile/client-app-screens.html — screens 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
 * See PhoneSteps for why these are screenshots rather than drawn screens.
 *
 * Rendered one step at a time at every width: StepPicker (a step list beside
 * one phone stage) on desktop, BookingCarousel (swipe) on mobile. Eight
 * screenshots in one static grid invited skimming exactly where this section
 * needs sequential attention — the two disclaimer gates included. Only one of
 * the two is displayed at a time (see .booking__wide / .booking__narrow), and a
 * display:none subtree neither loads its lazy images nor reaches assistive tech.
