/**
 * A numbered row of app screenshots on amber plates, used by BookingSteps and
 * DutySteps. Presentation only — each caller owns its own screens and copy.
 *
 * These are screenshots of the shipping client app, not drawings. That is the
 * opposite call to AppPreview and ProviderReel further down the page, which are
 * drawn from `.scr` primitives so they cannot go stale — worth stating, because
 * it is a real trade. What it buys is that the consent gates and the itemised
 * price are demonstrably the product's own screens rather than a marketing
 * rendering of them, which is the claim the compliance sections of the page are
 * already making in prose. What it costs is that these shots go stale silently
 * when the app reskins, so they need re-shooting on any UI change.
 *
 * Every frame renders at one fixed height rather than in a fixed aspect box.
 * The shots come off the device at slightly different ratios (1.94–2.04), and
 * matching heights is what the eye reads across a row; matching widths instead
 * would leave the plates ragged along the bottom.
