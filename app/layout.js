/* Organization is what lets Google attach the name, logo and site to one entity
   instead of inferring three. Only claims that are true on the page are here —
   no phone, no ratings, because unverifiable markup is the kind that gets a
   site a manual action rather than a rich result. The address and email
   *are* both already true on the page — they've been published on /privacy
   since it shipped — this just surfaces them in structured data too instead
   of leaving them undiscoverable outside one legal page.

   20fourr is the product; Indorse Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is the company that
   builds it. Stating the parent explicitly is what keeps searches for either
   name resolving to the same entity instead of two disconnected ones. */
